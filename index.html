                    <h3>Food for a family</h3>
                    <p>Hunger is one of the biggest issues the human race experiences. One in nine people in the world,
                        or 795 million people, out of the 7.4 billion people go hungry every day because they do not
                        have enough to eat. Every 10 seconds, a child dies from hunger-related diseases (The Hunger
                        Project, 2017). We are try to help these people.</p>

                    <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
                    <p> Homelessness is everywhere, it is not a new trend and is a growing problem. Many people ask
                        themselves should I help the homeless or not; it is easier to just ignore the problem than to
                        give a helping hand. Every person needs help at one point or another in their life and homeless
                        people should be no different. Assisting the homeless with healthcare, housing, and childcare
                        are ways people are able to and should help the homeless.

                    <h3>Education for a child</h3>
                    <p>A child’s right to education entails the right to learn. Yet, for too many children across the
                        globe, schooling does not lead to learning.
                        Over 600 million children and adolescents worldwide are unable to attain minimum proficiency
                        levels in reading and mathematics, even though two thirds of them are in school. For
                        out-of-school children, foundational skills in literacy and numeracy are further from grasp.
